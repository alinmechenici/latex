# Executive Summary

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity incidents in compliance with NIS2 Directive requirements. The plan ensures rapid detection, containment, eradication, and recovery from security incidents while meeting regulatory reporting obligations.

## Key Objectives
- Minimize impact of security incidents on business operations
- Ensure timely detection and response to incidents
- Comply with NIS2 incident reporting requirements
- Preserve evidence for investigations
- Learn from incidents to improve security posture

\caption{Incident Severity Classification}

## NIS2 Significant Incidents

A significant incident under NIS2 has caused or is capable of causing:
- Severe operational disruption of services or financial loss
- Considerable material or non-material damage to natural or legal persons

Significant incidents require reporting to competent authorities.

\end{center}

## Phase 1: Preparation

**Ongoing Activities:**
- Maintain incident response capabilities
- Conduct regular IR drills and tabletop exercises
- Update contact lists and escalation procedures
- Maintain incident response tools and access
- Train staff on incident reporting procedures

## Phase 2: Detection and Identification

**Detection Sources:**
- Security monitoring tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS)
- Automated alerts
- User reports
- External notifications (customers, partners, authorities)
- Threat intelligence

**Actions:**

- Receive and log incident report
- Assign incident ID and open ticket
- Perform initial triage
- Notify IR Team Leader

**Timeline:** Immediate (within 15 minutes of detection)

## Phase 3: Analysis and Scoping

**Actions:**

- Gather additional information
- Determine incident type and scope
- Assess impact and severity
- Identify affected systems and data
- Determine root cause
- Document findings

**Timeline:** 1-4 hours depending on complexity

**Key Questions:**
- What systems are affected?
- What data is at risk?
- How did the incident occur?
- Is the threat still active?
- What is the business impact?

## Phase 4: Containment

### Short-term Containment
**Immediate actions to prevent incident spread:**
- Isolate affected systems from network
- Disable compromised accounts
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Implement temporary access restrictions

### Long-term Containment
**Sustained measures while preparing for recovery:**
- Apply temporary patches or workarounds
- Implement enhanced monitoring
- Restore services to temporary infrastructure
- Continue evidence collection

**Timeline:** Critical incidents - within 1 hour; High - within 4 hours

## Phase 5: Eradication

**Actions:**

- Remove malware and backdoors
- Delete unauthorized accounts
- Close vulnerabilities exploited
- Reset compromised credentials
- Apply security patches
- Rebuild compromised systems if necessary

**Verification:**
- Scan systems for remaining threats
- Verify vulnerability remediation
- Confirm no persistence mechanisms remain

## Phase 6: Recovery

**Actions:**

- Restore systems from clean backups
- Verify system integrity
- Implement additional security controls
- Gradually return systems to production
- Monitor for signs of reinfection
- Validate business functionality

**Recovery Priorities:**

- Critical business systems (RTO < 4 hours)
- Essential services (RTO < 24 hours)
- Standard systems (RTO < 72 hours)

## Phase 7: Post-Incident Activities

**Lessons Learned Meeting:**
- Conduct within 2 weeks of incident closure
- Review incident timeline and response
- Identify what worked well
- Document areas for improvement
- Update procedures and controls

**Final Report Components:**
- Executive summary
- Incident timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Response effectiveness
- Recommendations
- Action items
