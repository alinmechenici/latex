# Quick Reference

\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
**DATA BREACH - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

**Indicators:**
- Unauthorized access to databases
- Data exfiltration alerts
- Misconfigured systems exposing data
- External notification of leaked data
- Dark web monitoring alerts

**CRITICAL TIMELINE:**
- **NIS2**: 24h early warning, 72h notification, 1 month final report
- **GDPR**: 72 hours to DPA (Data Protection Authority)
- **Data Subjects**: Without undue delay if high risk

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

- CONTAIN: Stop data exfiltration
- ASSESS: Determine scope and impact
- NOTIFY: IR Team, CISO, Legal, DPO
- PRESERVE: Collect forensic evidence
- REPORT: Initiate regulatory notifications

\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

# Phase 1: Detection & Containment (0-2 Hours)

## Detection Methods

**Internal Detection:**
- DLP (Data Loss Prevention) alerts
- SIEM unusual data transfer patterns
- Database audit logs
- Cloud access security broker (CASB)
- Network traffic anomalies

**External Notification:**
- Security researcher report
- Customer complaint
- Media inquiry
- Dark web monitoring service
- Law enforcement notification

## Immediate Containment Actions

**Stop Data Exposure (0-30 min):**

- Take misconfigured system offline
- Revoke compromised credentials
- Block unauthorized IP addresses
- Disable compromised accounts
- Close exposed ports/services
- Remove publicly accessible data

**Preserve Evidence (30-60 min):**
- Capture system logs
- Database access logs
- Network traffic captures
- Screenshots of exposure
- User activity logs

**Notify IR Team (60-120 min):**
- IR Team Leader
- CISO
- Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Legal Counsel
- Privacy Team
- Communications Lead

# Phase 2: Assessment (2-24 Hours)

## Scope Determination

**Critical Questions:**

- What data was accessed/exposed?
- How much data? (number of records)
- What type of data? (personal, sensitive, financial)
- Who was affected? (customers, employees, partners)
- When did the breach occur?
- How long was data exposed?
- Was data exfiltrated or just accessed?
- Is data encrypted or plaintext?

## Data Classification

|p{9cm}|}

**Data Category** & **Examples & Impact** \\

\endfirsthead

**Data Category** & **Examples & Impact** \\

\endhead
**Personal Data** & Names, addresses, emails, phone numbers - GDPR applies \\

**Sensitive Personal Data** & Health, racial origin, political opinions, biometric - HIGH RISK \\

**Financial Data** & Bank accounts, credit cards (PCI DSS), payment information \\

**Authentication** & Passwords, security questions, MFA seeds - CRITICAL \\

**Business Data** & Trade secrets, IP, contracts, customer lists \\

\caption{Data Classification for Breach Assessment}

## Root Cause Analysis

**Common Causes:**
- Misconfigured cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Stolen/compromised credentials
- Insider threat (malicious or accidental)
- Phishing leading to account compromise
- Unpatched vulnerabilities
- Third-party/supply chain breach

## Impact Assessment

Number of individuals & [NUMBER] \\

Type of data & [PERSONAL/SENSITIVE/FINANCIAL] \\

Likelihood of misuse & [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] \\

# Phase 3: Regulatory Notification

## NIS2 Incident Reporting

**Significant Incident Criteria:**
- Service disruption
- Financial loss
- Considerable damage to persons

**Reporting Timeline:**

- **24 hours**: Early warning to competent authority
- **72 hours**: Incident notification with assessment
- **1 month**: Final detailed report

## GDPR Data Breach Notification

**72-Hour Rule:**

Must notify Data Protection Authority within 72 hours if:
- Breach likely to result in risk to individuals' rights and freedoms
- Personal data involved
- Not encrypted or otherwise protected

**DPA Notification Must Include:**

- Nature of breach
- Categories and approximate number of individuals
- Categories and approximate number of records
- Contact point (DPO)
- Likely consequences
- Measures taken or proposed

**Exceptions (No notification required if):**
- Data encrypted and key not compromised
- Technical/organizational measures prevent high risk
- Subsequent measures eliminate high risk

## Data Subject Notification

**Required if high risk to individuals**

**Notification Should Include:**
- Description of breach in clear language
- Contact point for more information (DPO)
- Likely consequences
- Measures taken to mitigate
- Recommendations for individuals (password reset, monitoring)

**Notification Methods:**
- Email (preferred)
- Letter (for those without email)
- Website notification (if contact details unavailable)
- Media announcement (for mass breaches)

# Phase 4: Remediation

## Short-term Actions (0-7 days)

- Fix vulnerability or misconfiguration
- Revoke all potentially compromised credentials
- Force password resets for affected accounts
- Enhanced monitoring of affected systems
- Remove exposed data from public internet
- Contact search engines for de-indexing (if applicable)

## Medium-term Actions (7-30 days)
- Security audit of similar systems
- Implement additional controls
- Third-party security assessment
- Dark web monitoring for exposed data
- Credit monitoring for affected individuals (if applicable)
- Review and update security policies

## Long-term Actions (30+ days)
- Architecture review and improvements
- Enhanced security controls implementation
- Staff training and awareness
- Process improvements
- Technology upgrades

# Phase 5: Communication

## Internal Communications

\centering

**Audience** & **Message** & **Timing** \\

Executive Team & Full details, impact & Immediate \\

Employees & Need-to-know basis & Within 24h \\

Legal/Compliance & Complete information & Immediate \\

Customer Service & FAQs, talking points & Before public notice \\

\caption{Internal Communication Plan}

## External Communications

**Press Release/Public Statement:**
- Approved by Legal Counsel

- Log all inquiries

# Decision Trees

## GDPR Notification Decision Tree

- **Q:** Is personal data involved? \\
    NO → No GDPR notification required \\
    YES → Continue
- **Q:** Is data encrypted with key not compromised? \\
    YES → No notification required (document decision) \\
    NO → Continue
- **Q:** Likely to result in risk to individuals? \\
    NO → No notification required (document decision) \\
    YES → **Notify DPA within 72 hours**
- **Q:** High risk to individuals? \\
    NO → DPA notification only \\
    YES → **Notify DPA AND data subjects without undue delay**
