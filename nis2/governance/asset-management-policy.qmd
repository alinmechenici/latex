# Purpose
This Asset Management Policy establishes requirements for identifying, tracking, and managing information assets to support NIS2 compliance and cybersecurity risk management.

# Scope
This policy applies to all information assets including:
- Hardware (servers, workstations, network devices, mobile devices)
- Software (applications, operating systems, licenses)
- Data and information
- Cloud services and SaaS applications
- Network infrastructure
- Documentation and procedures

# Policy Statements

## Asset Inventory

### Inventory Requirements
- Complete inventory of all IT assets maintained
- Automated discovery tools deployed
- Manual verification quarterly
- Asset information updated within 48 hours of changes
- Centralized asset management database (CMDB)

### Asset Information
Each asset record must include:
- Asset ID (unique identifier)
- Asset type and category
- Owner and custodian
- Location (physical or virtual)
- Status (active, inactive, retired)
- Criticality rating
- Purchase date and cost
- Warranty and support information
- Configuration details
- Dependencies

## Asset Classification

\centering

|}

**Criticality** & **Description** \\

**Critical** & Essential for business operations; failure causes immediate severe impact \\

**High** & Important for operations; failure causes significant impact within hours \\

**Medium** & Supports business operations; failure causes moderate impact within days \\

**Low** & Non-essential; failure causes minimal impact \\

\caption{Asset Criticality Classification}

## Asset Lifecycle Management

### Acquisition

- Business justification and approval
- Security requirements defined
- Procurement through approved vendors
- Security assessment completed
- Asset registered in CMDB
- Security baseline configuration applied
- Ownership and responsibility assigned

### Deployment
- Hardening according to security standards
- Installation of security agents (antivirus, EDR)
- Network access controls applied
- Monitoring and logging configured
- Documentation updated
- User training provided (if applicable)

### Operations and Maintenance
- Regular patching and updates
- Performance monitoring
- Configuration management
- Quarterly asset verification
- License compliance tracking
- Documentation maintenance

### Retirement and Disposal

- Decommissioning approval obtained
- Data backup (if needed)
- Secure data sanitization/destruction
- Physical destruction (if required)
- Certificate of destruction obtained
- Asset record updated to "Retired"
- Removal from monitoring systems
- License reclamation

## Data Sanitization Standards

\centering

**Asset Type** & **Data Classification** & **Method** \\

Hard Drives & Confidential/Critical & Degaussing + Physical destruction \\

Hard Drives & Internal/Public & Secure wipe (3+ passes) \\

SSDs & Any & Crypto erase + Physical destruction \\

Mobile Devices & Any & Factory reset + Encryption key destruction \\

Removable Media & Confidential & Physical destruction \\
