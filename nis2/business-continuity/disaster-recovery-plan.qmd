- Network and communications
- Cloud services and SaaS applications
- Third-party IT services

# Disaster Declaration

## Disaster Definition
A disaster is an event that causes:

- Catastrophic data loss or corruption
- Major infrastructure failure preventing normal operations

## Authority to Declare Disaster
Authorized personnel:
- Chief Information Officer (CIO)
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

## Declaration Process

- Assess severity and scope of incident
- Determine if recovery within normal timeframe is possible
- Consult with Crisis Management Team
- Formally declare disaster
- Activate DR team and procedures
- Notify all stakeholders

- **Archive:** Tape storage off-site (7-year retention)

## Backup Verification
- Daily: Automated backup success monitoring
- Weekly: Random restoration test of 5 files/databases
- Monthly: Full restoration test of one critical system
- Quarterly: Complete DR site restoration test

# Recovery Procedures

## Phase 1: Assessment (0-1 hour)

### Actions

- Assess disaster scope and impact
- Identify affected systems and services
- Determine estimated recovery time with primary site
- Decide on DR site activation
- Notify DR team members
- Assemble at Emergency Operations Center (EOC)

### Decision Criteria
Activate DR site if:
- Primary site unavailable for >4 hours (estimated)
- Physical damage to data center
- Complete power or cooling failure
- Natural disaster affecting region
- Security breach requiring infrastructure rebuild

## Phase 2: Activation (1-4 hours)

### Infrastructure Activation

- Notify DR site provider
- Verify DR site availability and readiness
- Establish network connectivity to DR site
- Activate compute and storage resources
- Configure network routing and firewalls
- Test connectivity and accessibility

### Data Replication

- Verify last successful replication timestamp
- Assess data currency (how recent)
- Break replication from primary (if accessible)
- Prepare data for recovery
- Document data loss window (if any)

## Phase 3: Recovery (4-24 hours)

### System Recovery Order

**Priority 1 (0-4 hours):**

- Network infrastructure and firewalls
- Active Directory and authentication services
- Email and communication systems
- [Critical Application 1]
- [Critical Application 2]

**Priority 2 (4-24 hours):**

- [Important Application 1]
- [Important Application 2]
- File and collaboration services
- Monitoring and management tools

**Priority 3 (24-72 hours):**

- [Standard Application 1]
- [Standard Application 2]
- Development and test environments
- Reporting and analytics systems

### Recovery Procedures by System

**[Critical System 1] Recovery:**

- Power on DR site servers
- Verify latest backup/replication data
- Restore database from most recent backup
- Apply transaction logs (if available)
- Start application services
- Verify application functionality
- Update DNS to point to DR site
- Test user access and key functions
- Monitor for errors
- Declare system operational

*Estimated Time: 2 hours*
*Team: Infrastructure Lead, Database Lead, Application Lead*

## Phase 4: Verification (Ongoing)

### System Validation
- Functionality testing of all recovered systems
- Performance benchmarking
- Security controls verification
- Data integrity checks
- Integration testing between systems
- User acceptance testing

### Monitoring
- Enhanced monitoring of recovered systems
- Capacity and performance tracking
- Error and exception logging
- User issue tracking
- Daily status reports to management

# Failback Procedures

## Failback Planning
Once primary site is restored:

- Assess primary site readiness
- Plan failback window (minimize business impact)
- Communicate planned downtime to users
- Prepare data synchronization strategy
- Test failback procedures in isolated environment

## Failback Execution

- Synchronize data from DR to primary site
- Verify data consistency
- Plan cutover timing
- Perform gradual failback (by tier)
- Test each system after failback
- Update DNS and routing
- Monitor primary site stability
- Maintain DR site active for 48 hours (rollback capability)
- Decommission DR resources after confirmation

## Post-Failback
- Verify all systems operational on primary
- Document lessons learned
- Update DR procedures based on experience
- Restore normal backup schedules
- Conduct post-incident review
