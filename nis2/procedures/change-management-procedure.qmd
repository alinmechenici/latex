# Scope
Applies to all changes affecting:
- Production IT systems and applications
- Network infrastructure
- Security controls
- Databases
- Cloud infrastructure
- Critical business services

# Change Categories

## Standard Change
**Definition:** Pre-approved, low-risk, routine changes with documented procedures

**Examples:**
- Routine patch deployments (approved list)
- User account provisioning
- Standard software installations
- Scheduled backup configuration updates

**Approval:** Pre-authorized, no CAB review required

## Normal Change
**Definition:** Planned changes requiring CAB review and approval

**Examples:**
- Application upgrades
- Infrastructure modifications
- New system deployments
- Configuration changes to critical systems

**Approval:** Change Advisory Board (CAB)

## Emergency Change
**Definition:** Urgent changes required to resolve critical issues or security threats

**Examples:**

- Critical bug fixes

**Approval:** Emergency CAB (E-CAB) or designated authority

# Change Management Process

\end{center}

## Phase 1: Change Request

### Initiating a Change
All changes must be submitted via:
- Change management ticketing system
- Change Request Form (see Appendix A)
- Email to: changes@[ORGANIZATION].com (for emergencies)

### Required Information
- Change requestor name and contact
- Change category (Standard/Normal/Emergency)
- Business justification
- Systems and services affected
- Proposed implementation date/time
- Estimated duration
- Risk assessment
- Rollback plan
- Testing plan
- Communication plan

## Phase 2: Assessment

### Change Manager Review

- Validate completeness of request
- Verify change category classification
- Assess impact and risk
- Identify dependencies
- Check for conflicts with other changes
- Determine approval path

### Risk Assessment

\centering

|}

**Risk Level** & **Criteria** \\

**High** & Affects critical systems, customer-facing services, or has potential for significant business impact \\

**Medium** & Affects important systems, requires coordination across teams, moderate business impact possible \\

**Low** & Affects non-critical systems, minimal coordination needed, limited business impact \\

\caption{Risk Assessment Criteria}

## Phase 3: Approval

### Change Advisory Board (CAB)

**Composition:**
- Change Manager (Chair)
- IT Operations Manager
- Application Development Manager
- Information Security Manager
- Business Representative(s)
- Relevant Technical SMEs

**Meeting Schedule:**
- Regular CAB: Weekly (Tuesdays, 10:00 AM)
- Emergency CAB: As needed (within 2 hours of request)

**CAB Responsibilities:**
- Review change requests
- Assess risks and impacts
- Approve, reject, or defer changes
- Prioritize changes
- Authorize implementation schedule

### Approval Authority

Emergency & Any & E-CAB or CIO/CISO & Within 2 hours \\

\caption{Approval Authority Matrix}

## Phase 4: Planning

### Implementation Planning
- Detailed step-by-step procedure
- Resource assignment (personnel, tools, time)
- Communication plan
- Testing and validation steps
- Rollback procedure (mandatory)
- Contingency plans

### Change Window

**Standard Change Windows:**
- **Production Systems:** Saturdays 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM
- **Non-critical Systems:** Weekdays 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM
- **Emergency:** As required (business impact considered)

**Blackout Periods:**
- Month-end close: Last 3 days of month
- Year-end close: December 26 - January 5
- Major business events: [LIST SPECIFIC DATES]

### Rollback Planning
Every change must have a documented rollback plan:
- Rollback triggers (when to initiate)
- Rollback procedure (step-by-step)
- Rollback time estimate
- Rollback authorization
- Data recovery procedures (if applicable)

## Phase 5: Implementation

### Pre-Implementation

- Final approval confirmation
- Stakeholder notification (24 hours advance)
- Backup verification
- Team readiness check
- Communication to users (if needed)

### During Implementation
- Follow documented procedure exactly
- Document all actions taken
- Report progress at defined checkpoints
- Maintain communication channel open
- Monitor system status continuously
- Be prepared to execute rollback if needed

### Rollback Triggers
Initiate rollback if:
- Implementation exceeds allocated time window
- Critical errors encountered
- System instability observed
- Security issues identified
- Business impact exceeds acceptable threshold
- Unable to complete all planned steps

## Phase 6: Verification

### Post-Implementation Validation
- Functional testing (verify intended outcome achieved)
- Performance testing (no degradation)
- Security validation (controls still effective)
- Integration testing (dependent systems working)
- User acceptance (if applicable)
- Monitoring review (no errors or alerts)

### Success Criteria
Change considered successful when:
- All planned changes implemented
- Testing confirms expected results
- No new errors or issues introduced
- System performance meets requirements
- No rollback required
- Stakeholders confirm acceptance

## Phase 7: Closure

### Documentation
Complete and attach to change record:
- Implementation results
- Issues encountered and resolutions
- Actual vs. planned timeline
- Configuration updates
- Lessons learned
- Final sign-off

### Post-Implementation Review (PIR)
Required for:
- All high-risk changes
- Failed changes or rollbacks
- Changes with significant impact

**PIR Components:**
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Issues and root causes
- Action items for improvement
- Knowledge base updates

# Emergency Change Process

## Emergency Change Criteria

- Contact E-CAB members
- Brief summary of change and risk
- **Approval** (15-30 min)
- E-CAB review (virtual meeting or email)
- CIO or CISO approval
- Document approval in ticket
- **Implementation** (30 min - 4 hours)
- Execute change per documented plan
- Continuous communication
- Rollback available
- **Follow-up** (within 48 hours)
- Present to full CAB (next meeting)
- Complete documentation
