# Purpose
This procedure establishes a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in compliance with NIS2 requirements.

# Scope
Applies to all IT systems, applications, and network infrastructure:
- Servers (physical and virtual)
- Workstations and laptops
- Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Applications (commercial and custom-developed)
- Databases
- Cloud infrastructure and services
- IoT and operational technology (OT) devices

# Vulnerability Management Process

## Phase 1: Discovery and Scanning

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning

**Internal Network Scanning:**
- **Frequency:** Weekly (authenticated scans)
- **Tool:** [SCANNER NAME - e.g., Nessus, Qualys]
- **Scope:** All internal systems and network devices
- **Credentials:** Authenticated scans for deeper analysis

**External Network Scanning:**
- **Frequency:** Weekly
- **Tool:** [EXTERNAL SCANNER]
- **Scope:** All internet-facing systems and services
- **Method:** Unauthenticated (attacker's perspective)

**Web Application Scanning:**
- **Frequency:** Monthly for production, weekly for development
- **Tool:** [WEB SCANNER - e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP]
- **Scope:** All web applications
- **Tests:** OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

**Cloud Infrastructure Scanning:**
- **Frequency:** Daily (configuration drift detection)
- **Tool:** [CLOUD SECURITY POSTURE MANAGEMENT TOOL]
- **Scope:** All cloud resources (AWS/Azure/GCP)

### Manual Assessment
- **Penetration Testing:** Quarterly for critical systems
- **Code Review:** For all custom applications (pre-release)
- **Architecture Review:** For new systems and major changes

## Phase 2: Analysis and Prioritization

### Vulnerability Triage Process

- **Automated Import:** Scan results imported to vulnerability management platform
- **Deduplication:** Eliminate duplicate findings
- **False Positive Review:** Security team reviews findings
- **Context Addition:** Add asset criticality and business context
- **Exploitability Assessment:** Check for known exploits
- **Priority Scoring:** Calculate risk-based priority

### Risk-Based Prioritization

Priority Score = (CVSS Base Score) × (Asset Criticality) × (Threat Level)

**Asset Criticality Multiplier:**
- Critical Business System: 2.0
- Important System: 1.5
- Standard System: 1.0
- Non-production: 0.5

**Threat Level Multiplier:**
- Active exploitation in wild: 2.0
- Public exploit available: 1.5
- Proof-of-concept exists: 1.2
- Theoretical vulnerability: 1.0

## Phase 3: Remediation

### Remediation Options

**1. Patching (Preferred)**
- Apply vendor-provided security updates
- Test patches in non-production first
- Schedule maintenance window
- Execute change management process
- Verify successful remediation

**2. Configuration Change**
- Disable vulnerable service/feature
- Modify security settings
- Update access controls
- Document configuration change

**3. Compensating Controls**
- When patching not immediately possible
- Network segmentation
- Additional monitoring
- Enhanced access controls
- Web application firewall (WAF) rules

**4. Risk Acceptance**
- For low-risk vulnerabilities
- Documented business justification
- Approved by risk owner and CISO
- Time-bound (reviewed quarterly)
- Compensating controls documented

**5. System Decommissioning**
- If remediation not feasible
- End-of-life systems
- Cost-benefit analysis unfavorable

### Patch Management Process

**Critical and High Severity:**

- Vulnerability identified
- Emergency change request opened
- Patch tested in lab/dev environment (4-8 hours)
- Stakeholder notification
- Deployment to production
- Verification scan
- Documentation

**Medium and Low Severity:**

- Vulnerability added to patch backlog
- Included in monthly patch cycle
- Standard change management process
- Testing in pre-production
- Scheduled deployment
- Post-deployment verification

## Phase 4: Verification

### Remediation Verification
- Re-scan affected systems within 48 hours
- Verify vulnerability no longer present
- Check for any adverse effects
- Update vulnerability tracking system
- Close vulnerability ticket

### Metrics Collection
- Time to remediate by severity
- SLA compliance rate
- Number of vulnerabilities by severity
- Trend analysis (month-over-month)
- Top vulnerability types

## Phase 5: Reporting

### Regular Reports

**Weekly:**
- Critical vulnerabilities status
- Overdue remediations
- New high-severity findings

**Monthly:**
- Comprehensive vulnerability report
- SLA compliance metrics
- Trend analysis
- Top vulnerable systems
- Remediation progress

**Quarterly:**
- Executive summary for management
- Year-over-year comparison
- Risk posture assessment
- Resource requirements

# Exception Process

## Exception Criteria
Exceptions to remediation timelines may be granted for:
- Vendor patch not yet available
- High business impact of downtime
- System compatibility issues
- Testing reveals critical bugs
- Scheduled decommissioning imminent

## Exception Approval

\centering

**Vulnerability Severity** & **Approver** & **Maximum Extension** \\

Critical & CISO + CIO & 7 days \\

High & CISO & 30 days \\

Medium & IT Manager & 60 days \\

Low & Team Lead & 120 days \\

\caption{Exception Approval Authority}

## Exception Documentation
All exceptions must document:
- Business justification
- Compensating controls implemented
- Risk owner approval
- Extended deadline
- Review date

# Special Considerations

## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

- Immediate threat assessment
- Emergency security team meeting
- Implement compensating controls
- Enhanced monitoring
- Communication to stakeholders
- Apply vendor patch as soon as available

## Vulnerabilities in Production Systems
- Expedited change management process
- Rollback plan mandatory
- Extended monitoring post-deployment
- Business continuity plan review

## Third-Party/Vendor Systems
- Vendor notification of findings
- Track vendor response time
- Escalate per contract SLA
- Document in vendor risk register
- Consider compensating controls
